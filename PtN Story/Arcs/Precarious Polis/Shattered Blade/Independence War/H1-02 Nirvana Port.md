The [[White Sands]] route from [[Nirvana Port]] to the [[Metropoles]] allows the Guerrilla forces under [[Brock]] more mobility and a secure supply route.

On March 17, N.F. 64 Brock sneaks into Nirvana Port with a supply Convoy. By coincidence he ran into [[Dravyn Steel]], a friend from military school. Who promtly delivered a chewing out from [[Helena]], a common friend and EDGE scientist. But she also offered them [[EDGE Contact|covert support]] with their gear.
