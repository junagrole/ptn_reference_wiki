After being knocked out by [[Dr. Iron]] you regain your sense facing the bright lights of an operating room. Sedated you're barely conscious, while Dr. Iron and a nurse note that your brain function is fine, apart from a damaged memory. 

Measuring your [[M-Value]] gives them a big surprise though, even though you have been exposed to so many [[Maniacs]]. Even your two companions are completely stable after all the fights. Before you pass out again they discuss the origin of your power and what they could use you for.

Awaking in a hospital ward you find yourself weak but fine and can sense Hella and Hecate nearby. But the hysterical cries in the distance aren't the worst omen, next to you on a sick bed is the Sinner that tried to kill you [[01-02 Assassination|when you arrived in Syndicate.]] The [[Gray-haired Girl|wounded girl]] just stares back at you.
