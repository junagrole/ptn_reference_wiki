Even after the [[Gonzales]] gangsters are beaten, [[Ted|Ted's]] men continue attacking them. They too have become [[Maniacs|infected with Mania]]. [[Hella]] urges him to withdraw them, but to Ted all that matters is that they have become stronger and can storm [[SALVA Hospital]] now.

A group of armed doctors leave the hospital ready to subdue the gangsters for treatment. With the two Sinners at your side you claim victory. The lead doctor, a former member of Teds gang, scolds Ted for letting his men get infected with Mania. But Ted just calls him a traitor and proceeds to go to SALVA.

Holding onto you the doctor inquires about [[Dr. Brand]] and [[Laura]] being late. Fearing something happened to them while they were out treating gangsters. Annoyed Ted interrupts you, but is in turn interrupted by the appearance of Dr. Brand himself.
