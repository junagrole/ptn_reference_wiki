The three of you are cornered by the gang fights and can't break through. [[Nightingale]] calls and promises reinforcements a bit further ahead.

[[Hecate]] buys you time, [[Ted]] complains, while [[Hella]] is searching, but finds only a dumpster. Turns out it contains their reinforcements. The bound Sinner [[K.K.]] protests her innocence, but Nightingale just tells you to get on with it and Shackle her. They will definitely find justification for arresting a [[Sinner]] in Syndicate later on.

After getting your "reinforcements" Nightingale explains that communication in [[Syndicate]] is insecure and might give them away.  Because of the leaked intelligence they will go radio silent until the source is identified while trying to distract the pursuers.
