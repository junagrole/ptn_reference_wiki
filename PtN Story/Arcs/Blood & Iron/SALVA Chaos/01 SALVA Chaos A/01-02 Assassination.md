After the gang members that attacked the MBCC team were subdued. [[Hella]] is really excited about the fight and mocks you for being so guarded around her.  The gang member curses out the Sinners until he's shut up by Hella's pipe. Hella explains that the gangs are always fighting like this. The gangs fight every summer to appoint a "Syndicate Boss", which makes her wonder why they still have so much energy left in them. Hella mockingly warns you to be careful, lest you die on your first mission. Which prompts Hecate to coldly threaten Hella that she better keep you alive or she will deal with her.

[[Hecate]]'s suspicion that the gang members are driven by [[Mania]] is confirmed when a [[Gray-haired Girl|young girl with grey hair]] appears. The grey haired Sinner uses her power to drive the gangs into a Mania fuelled frenzy and attack you, the holder of the [[Shackles]].

With the mission being obviously leaked Hella and Hecate disagree about whether to find the traitor or protecting you. The [[Sinner]] attacking you directly cuts the argument short. Suddenly several gunshots ring out, forcing the severely wounded girl to retreat. You try to give chase but the shooter calls out to you. Rather than charging into alleys filled with Mania corrupted gangers, you follow him.

Amidst the background of the Mania fuelled riot the man calls you ignorant of the situation in [[Syndicate]], which he blames on Mania running rampant and the Sinners spreading it. Belatedly he introduces himself as [[Ted]]. An informant of the [[Public Security Bureau]] sent to help you. He's a gangster on a crusade against Mania, which is why he wants to work with the MBCC. To ease your doubts he produces a working communicator and calls [[Nightingale]].
