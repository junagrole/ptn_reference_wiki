The party reaches the gates of [[SALVA Hospital]], which is besieged by around 30 members of the [[Gonzales]] gang. They know [[Ted]] and want to take him out before storming SALVA.
When [[Hella]] get ready for a fight [[Hecate]] warns you all that they are [[Maniacs|infected by Mania]] causing them to frenzy.
