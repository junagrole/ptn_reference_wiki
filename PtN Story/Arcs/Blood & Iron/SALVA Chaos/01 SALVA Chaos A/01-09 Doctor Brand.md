Facing [[Dr. Brand]] again [[Ted]] promptly shoots the doctor before anyone could stop him. But the bullet is stopped by a black smoke. [[Hecate]] warns you that his power is much stronger than a regular [[Maniacs]].

Murmuring to himself about saving his colleagues Gray, Han and [[Laura]], he turns into a [[Corruptors|Corruptor]] before your eyes. Black spikes shoot out of him and twist his body into a troll like figure. Barely capable of speech, only driven by the urge to punish those who hurt his team.

While the Corruptor swiftly takes down Ted's men, [[Hella]] and [[Hecate]] move to protect you. After a ferocious battle with the powerful Corruptor Ted is nowhere to be seen. Before moving on into [[SALVA Hospital]] you notice a scent coming from the Corruptor, almost like a [[Sinner|Sinners]]. Before you can investigate further you all get taken out by a nerve toxin.

[[Dr. Iron]] arrived with [[Anne]], only to say goodbye to Dr. Brand. Sarcastically she welcomes you as "Chief Lapdog"
