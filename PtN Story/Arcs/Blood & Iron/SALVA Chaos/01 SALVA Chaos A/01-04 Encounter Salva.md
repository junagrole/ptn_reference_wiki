As you get closer to [[SALVA Hospital]] you find more and more remains of gangs that have attacked the Hospital, but contaminated by [[Mania|Mania]] they started fighting each other instead. [[Ted]] accuses SALVA of being responsible, but before you can question him further you stumble upon several doctors, with many of them having mechanical [[Prosthesis]]. They carry away several gangsters on stretchers, among them one of Teds man.
Ted identifies their [[Dr. Brand|leader]] as the man that took in [[Subject R]] and calls upon you to attack them to acquire intelligence.
