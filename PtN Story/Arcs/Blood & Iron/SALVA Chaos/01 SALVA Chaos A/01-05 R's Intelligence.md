After a tough fight [[Ted]] claims that the [[SALVA Hospital|SALVA]] doctors were gangsters before becoming doctors. He shoots an injured [[Laura|nurse]] to force a distraught [[Dr. Brand|doctor]] to give him intelligence about [[Subject R]].

Panicked the doctor reveals that the head nurse [[Anne]] send the [[Horro|fugitive Sinner]] into the basement at SALVA.

The only other thing he knows is that she was talking about an [[Inheritance]] while half conscious. Ted is exuberant at the mention of the Inheritance, which he describes as the source of [[Syndicate]]s mania crisis.

Finding out that with  [[Dr. Iron]] the doctors couldn't notify [[The Legion]] about it, Ted shoots Laura. But at the last moment [[Hecate]] and [[Nightmare]] divert the bullet. Ted argues with you that they need to die to prevent intel getting back to SALVA.

The arguments gets interrupted by a grenade hitting the ambulance causing a swarm of 
[[Corruptors]] the doctors have been gathering to attack you.

Ted explains that [[Maniacs]] will turn into Corruptors and that SALVA is studying the process to obtain the power of [[Mania]]. Which causes an argument between him and [[Hella]]. To prevent a fight with Teds men from breaking out you stop Hella with your [[Shackles]]. This predictably enrages Hella and baffles Ted.

The group leaves the frantic doctor and the dying nurse behind and join up with Teds men.
