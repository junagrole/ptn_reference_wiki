[[Ted]] brings you to his stronghold where you're greeted by his men. Their attitude soon turns hostile when they learn the two "pretty gals" are [[Sinner|Sinners]].

But you being able to restrain them with your [[Shackles]] earns their approval. Even is now very respectful of you when you step away for a discussion. You insist he should restrain his men and leave your Sinners alone. But Ted considers them just as tools you can order around with your Shackles.

Meanwhile inside the gangsters insulting [[Hella]] has led to a fight. [[Hecate]] reports one of the now downed men hit Hella with a stick first. Hearing that you side with the dumbfounded Hella. Since Ted refuses to solve the problem you decide to solve it by beating them all up. 

Soon after Hella is happy and the gangsters are crying for mercy. Unmoved by their pleas Ted just pistol whips one and apologies to you. He appreciates you settling the argument in good [[Syndicate]] tradition.

Hella comes over to warn you about Teds insincerity and tease you about the two of them being that important to you. Brushing away your explanation she nevertheless appreciates you standing up for her before leaving.
