During the battle against the manic gangsters you three need a break. With [[Hella]] reluctantly holding the line, [[Hecate]] unceremoniously tosses you into a dumpster and rejoins Hella in the fight.

But you're not alone in the dumpster besides you is the Sinner [[Labyrinth]]. Most of her body is mechanical and she reboots when you touch her. But in the process she dumps her memory.

After the reboot is complete she goes into AI Maid mode and offers to serve you before helping out in the battle. Hella is confused why there is a robot in a [[Syndicate]] back alley.

She notes that she has a complete human nervous system and compares herself with Hecate, who she considers an inferior tool. Needing serious repairs, she urges you to bring her into [[SALVA Hospital]] prosthesis repair centre. 

She doesn't remember Mary anymore, so you decide to get her repaired at the MBCC in the hope of recovering her memories.
