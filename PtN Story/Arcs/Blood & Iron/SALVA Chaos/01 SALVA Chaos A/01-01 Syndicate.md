The chapter starts in Chiefs Office with a flashback to Chief getting briefed [[Nightingale]]. In the aftermath of the [[MBCC Riot]] many of the Sinners fled to [[Syndicate]] which caused major riots. The [[Public Security Bureau]] has confirmed that [[Subject R]] also escaped into Syndicate. They promise assistance and intelligence if the MBCC can deal with the cause of the riot first.
Chief is to lead a small group of [[Sinner|Sinners]] into Syndicate to arrest the fugitive Sinners. A covert operation is necessary since Syndicate is ruled by gangs. 

We return to the present with the MBCC team, Chief, [[Hella]] and [[Hecate]] reached the local security precinct in Syndicate. The riot has already reached it and even breached the gate. Nearly a hundred gangs are involved in a free for all fight and attack the team as well. Hella feels right at home in the chaos and gets ready to fight.

Back to the briefing you learn that Syndicate has been effectively lawless for the past twenty years. The City Council eventually abandoned the whole West District to the gangs when they signed the [[West District Management Regulations]] regulations. Right now Syndicate is de facto ruled by gangs.

In the present Hella mocks a gangster that's about to attack them, clearly enjoying herself. Predictably a fight broke out.
