In the local security precinct [[Ted]] tries to contact the [[Public Security Bureau]]. You have little time since an organisation of Sinners operating in [[Syndicate]] will soon catch wind of your presence. According to Ted, [[Subject R]] found refuge with one such organisation: [[SALVA Hospital]]. Before you can make plans a heavy tank arrives reducing the building to rubble. The enemy force it led by a powerful Sinner and with the precinct already fallen you have no choice but to retreat.

Under cover from [[Hella]] and [[Hecate]] you break trough the enemies and take refuge in the sewers. Hella recognised the enemy as [[The Legion]], led by the extremely powerful Sinner [[Zoya]]. Surprised by the speed his most hated enemy has found them with, Ted suggest to link up with his forces and attack SALVA before the Legion figures out your target. Hecate argues with him, but leaves the choice of proceeding or retreating to you. Wanting to catch Subject R and find answers you overrule her concerns and Hella's warning not to trust a gangster.
