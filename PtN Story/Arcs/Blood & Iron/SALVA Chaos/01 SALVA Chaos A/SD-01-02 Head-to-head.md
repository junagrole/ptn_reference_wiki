A bit further ahead you find [[EMP]] cornered by gangsters. Being dragged into the conflict when the gangsters recognise [[Ted]] with two Sinners, you make short work of them.

Initially mouthing off to you, she soon pleads to be spared by [[Hecate|"Lord Hecate"]]. While EMP and [[Hella]] bicker among each other you shackle her.
