Back up in the ward the [[Gray-haired Girl]] is having a mania flare up, opening her wounds again and causing her great pain. [[Anne]] does her best to calm her down, while [[Dr. Iron]] treats her.

>[!cite] Dr. Iron
>Don't look away, the Chief of Minos. You must understand [[Mania]], the end of Sinners.
>Mania isn't power and mutation. It's an irreversible mental breakdown.

>[!info] [[M-Value]]
Normal humans can only endure an M value of about 200, before turning into [[Corruptors]]. But [[Sinner|Sinners]] have at least an initial M value of 600, even initially. Unlike normal humans they can retain their sanity, but they still suffer from the corruption. Increasing M value brings with it stronger powers, but also greater mental instability, until they break down like normal [[Maniacs]]

Mania infection can be spread by anyone who gets close to the threshold, be it Maniacs or Sinners. Unfortunately this is exactly what happens to the young girl. Even normally there is no known way to reverse a mania infection, but in this case there is an even worse complication.

A remote controlled capsule filled with [[Mania Crystal|liquid Mania Crystals]] was implanted close to her heart. It's impossible to remove and when triggered will be enough to push the girl over the threshold immediately. Her master abused her, turned her into a weapon and sent her out to die. Even after loosing everything she's still holding on, past all of Dr. Irons estimates. 

[[Hecate]] stops you from using your [[Shackles]] on the lifeless girl, fearing that the contamination is already beyond your limits. This upsets Anne who wants to believe that she still can be saved, clearly tormented by guilt over failing to save patients in the past.

Suddenly [[SALVA Hospital]] is attacked by gangs again.
