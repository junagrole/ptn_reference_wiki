Still searching for [[Subject R]] [[Ted]] threatens [[Anne]] to reveal her whereabouts. The [[Gray-haired Girl]] is protecting Ted with a shield of black contamination spikes. But her contamination has already reached critical levels.

[[Hella]] encourages her to leave the scumbag, but the abused girl is too used to be used a tool. Ordering his "dog" to stay behind and kill you all he continues his search for the target. As the young Sinner raises dead bodies as mania puppets Anne pleads with you to stop her.
