With things calming down again [[Dr. Iron]] and [[Anne]] measure the [[M-Value]] of our two Sinners. To their astonishment they are already returning to normal levels, even after the fight.
Before they can delve deeper into the implications and the nature of the [[Shackles]] an emergency in the isolation ward forces Iron bring everyone along.

The isolation ward is filled with [[Maniacs|manic patients]], mostly [[Ted|Ted's]] men. His second in command is close to the threshold of turning into a [[Corruptors|Corruptor]] and Dr. Iron intents to test your Shackles on him. 

A [[Mania]] infection only worsens over time until the infected breaks down and turns into a Corruptor.  But Iron surmises that you're immune to the effects of Mania and hopes to have found the key to finally healing it.
