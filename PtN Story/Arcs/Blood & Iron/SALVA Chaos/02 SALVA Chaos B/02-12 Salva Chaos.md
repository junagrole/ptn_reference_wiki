As the [[Gray-haired Girl]] reaches her limit and explosively falls apart, [[Anne]] rushes into the danger still intent to save the girl. Severely injured she cradles the dead girl in her arms, fruitlessly injecting Serum into her frozen body. But it is far to late, the lower part of her body has completely disintegrated. 

Despite the dangers those [[Corruptors|contaminated]] remains pose to her already fragile mind, she carries the girls torso to a [[SALVA Hospital|secret room]]. Testament to her frantic wish to save her patients the room is filled with Corruptor remains, preserved in medical tanks.

Anne just wishes to be alone with her dead patients, only the hope that somehow they can revived holding her together, albeit barely. Closing the door, she cuts herself of from you and the ranting [[Ted]]. Agitated he curses Sinners, wishing them an agonising death.

Reaching a critical level the contamination gives birth to monsters. A timely distraction for Ted who promptly flees the scene. Surprisingly the monsters ignore him, [[Hella]] notices something in his hands that seems to protect him.

Enraged by the gangsters monstrous deeds you order [[Hecate]] to punish him. Slowed by the monsters you fail to catch up with him. Talking with himself Ted reveals that he is working on someones behalf. Frightened to disappoint the people who gave him the protective charm he comes up with a Plan B. If he can't bring them [[Subject R]] maybe destroying SALVA and bringing them the corpse of the [[Chief|MBCC Chief]] will save his life. They hate the MBCC after all.
Simply organising another raid utilising his remaining [[Mania Crystal]] should do the trick.

Just making it out he runs into [[Dr. Iron]] instead. She gave him an [[Prosthesis|artificial eye]] some time ago. A procedure that made him unable to use Mania Crystals himself. Still he chose to infect gang members, enslave Sinners, destroy her hospital and chase the [[Inheritance]]. For all his supposed hatred of Mania, he will never give up on attaining it. As a doctor she still won't kill him. 

Finally catching up with Ted you find him and all his gangsters kneeling in front of Iron, alive but lobotomised. She "treated" their violent behaviour with her power.
