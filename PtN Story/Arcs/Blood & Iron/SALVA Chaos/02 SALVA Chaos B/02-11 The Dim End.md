The [[Gray-haired Girl]] begs [[Anne]] to tell her the truth, is she beyond saving? But actually saying it is too much for Anne and you get a choice.

>[!caution] Give her hope
>She doesn't want any more lies and begs Anne for the truth again. Protecting herself against Ted with her power she continues asking Anne. Driven by her plight you ignore the danger and offer to contain the contamination with your Shackles. Sceptical about your motives and doubting your ability to do it she refuses. 
>  
>You stubbornly persevere and get her to consider it. Reaching out to her final hope it is ripped from her at the last moment as Ted trigger the mania fail-safe inside of her.


> [!caution] Tell her the truth
>Everyone here, the girl included, knows she is beyond saving. But she still has a choice, will she die as a human or a monster? Her own actions, not being a Sinner, determine which she will be in the end.
> 
> She calls [[Ted]] out for the horrifying abuse he put her through. How much a coward he is for being scared of her while still coveting her power. He purchased her, caged her, let his men beat and abused her. 
> >[!cite] Gray-haired Girl
> >I have no master.
> 
> Overwhelming Ted she crushes his trigger for the mania bomb fail-safe inside her. But finally being free she also let go of the obsession that let her endure her frightening contamination.
> 
> Anne pleads with her to continue fighting, but the young girl is content with reclaiming some of her lost humanity. Thanking Anne for being the only one that ever gave her hope she turns to you. Not even remembering her name she wants to die as a Sinner, not a slave or monster. Just a simple request, kill her before it's too late.
