Supported by [[Dr. Iron]] and your Sinners you attempt to use your [[Shackles]] on the [[Maniacs|manic gang member]]. But the attempt fails, Maniacs are fundamentally different from [[Sinner|Sinners]].
>[!cite] Chief's thoughts
>When binding Sinners, you can always hear some voice from the shackles - a cry from the dark. Yet you feel nothing but a dangerous mess on 728.

Stricken by the intense [[Mania]] radiating from the gang member you can only watch as he breaks free. Before anyone can stop him he breaks a [[Mania Crystal|red vial]] and the substance sinks into his skin. The substance drives him over the threshold and only Iron temporarily subduing him prevents 728 to turn into a [[Corruptors|Corruptor]].

Resonating with his outbreak the other patients in the ward deteriorate quickly. Starting with an old man ravaged by loss and Mania several patients turn into Corruptors. After dealing with them only 14 "humans" are left in the ward, but even they are in bad shape.

While [[Hecate]] pleads with you not to try that again you're sick enough to throw up at the spot. Though Iron is clearly disappointed that the treatment is not viable, she apologies for endangering you.
>[!cite] Dr. Iron
>You too, [[Chief]], get some rest. I was wrong. Mania can hurt you too.

You finally have the chance to discuss the situation with her. While she doesn't confirm the patient to be [[Subject R]], she does admit to taking in an injured Sinner. But insists that you wait until she recovers before investigating further.

Dismissing [[Ted|Ted's]] accusations, Iron explains to you that Mania is not caused by Sinners. Though the exact case remains unknown. But she suspects that the red vial plays a role in the [[Syndicate]] outbreak.
>[!cite] Dr. Iron
>[[Mania Crystal]]. Liquid. Unknown composition. It triggers Mania and accelerates mutation once injected into the human body.

Promising a quick route to immense power the gangs are doing everything to acquire it. Same with the [[Inheritance]], an object rumoured to control Mania, leading to the attack on [[SALVA Hospital]]. Mania driving even the patients she saved to attack the clinic in a wild frenzy has left her with a hatred of Mania. A hatred frightening in it's intensity.

Iron admits that Sinners draw their power from Mania as well, but don't seek it out willingly. Since words alone aren't enough to dispel your suspicions she intents to demonstrate it to you.
