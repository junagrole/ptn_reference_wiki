[[Ted]] urges you to infiltrate the basement and bring [[SALVA Hospital]] down together. [[Subject R]] and the [[Inheritance]] are here for the taking. 

Suspicious of him after seeing SALVA for yourself, you question him about the [[Gray-haired Girl]] but he denies any connection and blames it on a Sinner rebel group.
This only creates more doubt, the [[Mania Crystal]] inside the girl and the one his men were carrying are the same. Him missing any vital areas even though he's a good shot. All these inconsistencies would be explained if the girl was never there to kill you. Instead her mission was to stage Ted as your rescuer and gain your trust.

Even if he works [[Public Security Bureau]], that's exactly the department that leaked your presence to the gangs. It would be all to easy for Ted to orchestrate the whole thing.

Regretting your choice to decline a partnership he readily admits to everything. Nevertheless you missed one crucial part of his plan. The girl didn't come to SALVA on her own volition, but as part of her mission. To infiltrate the hospital and create a Mania crisis in the basement.

With his plan already in motion Ted enters the hospital while his goons delay you. To [[Hecate]] and [[Hella|Hellas]] disgust his men have been turned into [[Maniacs]] on purpose to pose a challenge to Sinners.
