The [[SALVA Hospital|basement]] is unexpectedly empty, with only a desk and a journal in the wide empty room. The isolation wards must be separated further in.

[[Anne|Anne's]] journal details her early days with the [[Banyan Medical College|Colleges]] quarantine facility in [[Syndicate]]. Their first use of [[M-Value]] to measure infection. Various infection vectors for [[Mania]] and the threshold before [[Maniacs]] turn into [[Corruptors]]. Gang violence is increasing and with it the spread of Mania soon exceeds the capacity of the facility.

Even after the College abandoned the project, Anne refuses to leave. Staying with the patients even as her own M-Value increases. Instead of turning into a Corruptor she becomes a [[Sinner]] but she still lost all her patients leaving her heavily contaminated. Still she refused to give up and vowed to find a way. Obsession is one of the symptoms of being a Sinner. 

Among the documents is also one about the [[DisSea explosion]]. A faded photo of a huge crimson halo over the [[DisSea]]. The first public Mania incident in N.F. 84.12.22 resulted in 87,231 Maniacs and the formation of the [[FAC]].

Your investigation is disturbed by a heavily contaminated SALVA doctor arriving from one of the wards. He is already beyond recovery and attacks you right away.

[[Hella]] and [[Hecate]] manage to track down Anne and [[Ted]], who are with the [[Gray-haired Girl]], leaving you little time to process the tragic end of doctors and patients alike. Using [[Nightmare]] to smash trough the wall reveals a blood soaked Anne cornered by Ted.
