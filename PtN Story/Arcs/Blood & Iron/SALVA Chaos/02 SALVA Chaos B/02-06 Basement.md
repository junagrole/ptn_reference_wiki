The gang members successfully delay your for close to 22 minutes, giving [[Ted]] a massive lead in the race to find [[Subject R]].

Racing after him you run into a [[SALVA Hospital]] Nurse cornered by former patient turned [[Corruptors]]. [[Nightmare]] saves her right in time but more corruptors are coming up from the basement. Blocking the isolation ward door gives you a brief respite.

Turning to the nurse for information you and [[Hella]] have to calm her down first, before she too succumbs to Mania. Before you came she saw Ted shoot a guard and enter the basement through its only exit. He hasn't come out since.

Before [[Hecate]] can tell the frantic Nurse that [[Anne]] and the patients are a lost cause, Hella steps in and promises her that they will bring them back. Leaving her behind to care for the remaining patients you enter the basement.
