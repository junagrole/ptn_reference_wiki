The corridor into the basement is covered in heavy enough [[Mania|contamination]] to become physical. Even for a [[Sinner]] the environment is dangerous, for ordinary people it would be lethal. [[Hella]] and [[Hecate]] are protected by the [[Shackles]], but the [[Gray-haired Girl]] and [[Anne]] are in grave danger. So is [[Ted]], unless he has prepared some unknown countermeasure. Even [[Subject R]] could succumb to contamination before you can reach her. The only way to save them would be using the Shackles before it's too late.

Soon you face several [[Maniacs]] turned [[Corruptors]], some of them even patients you and [[Dr. Iron]] treated earlier. After the disturbing fight you finally reach the final [[SALVA Hospital]] isolation ward.
