Still blocking your way the [[Gray-haired Girl]] is determined to fight you to the end, even though she's slowly turning into a [[Corruptors|Corruptor]]. Despite her own grievous injuries [[Anne]] is only concerned with saving the abused girl.

To stop the girl from consuming herself she injects herself with a drug. With her power transforming the medication into a booster she regains her vitality by risking her life. Stubbornly she ignores [[Hecate|Hecates]] appeal to reason and enters the fray alongside you.

With the contamination eating away at her body the fight is brief. Even the [[Shackles]] won't be able to reverse this level of corruption. You try to convince her to break free from [[Ted]], but to little effect. 

Anne, who wants to stay behind with the girl, is suddenly hit by gunfire. The man you were looking for came for you instead. Disabling you by shooting a gas tank he threatens Anne again. 

[[Subject R]] has evidently escaped from the isolation ward, causing Ted to take it out on Anne. He can't come back without R or the [[Inheritance]]. Black spikes stop him from torturing her further. The young girl has decided to fight back against her abuser.
