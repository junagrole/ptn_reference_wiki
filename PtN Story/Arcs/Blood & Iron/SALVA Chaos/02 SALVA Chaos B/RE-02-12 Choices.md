In front of the lobotomised gangsters you confront [[Dr. Iron]] about her methods. For her it's not just about people like [[Ted]], it's about treating the whole of [[Syndicate]]. As long as the violence among the gangs continues, [[Mania]] will never be contained.

This shouldn't rest on her shoulders, but the [[City Council]] just abandoned Syndicate with the [[West District Management Regulations]], leaving Syndicans no other choice but to deal with it themselves as best as they can. She is committed to this ideal to a frightening level.

Your argument gets interrupted by the arrival of [[The Legion]] who have caught up with you. You're no match for them, but Iron offers to buy you some time. For her you're someone who should remain clean, who shouldn't get dragged down into the violence.

With [[Subject R]] already escaped you have no reason to stay, but the unfinished business at SALVA makes you reluctant to leave. [[Hella]] spots an intact pick-up truck driven by [[Che|a young blond man]] and promptly hijacks it. She leaves him no choice but to flee from The Legion with your group. Hot on your heels is a [[Ninety-Nine|Sinner on a motorbike]]. You can't make out her features but the huge sword on her back speaks louder than words.
