Seeing what really happened in [[SALVA Hospital]] you decide to join the hospitals defence. While [[Dr. Iron]] and you fight off the large group of gangsters [[Anne]] evacuates the patients into the basement, worried that the fight will trigger their Mania.

But the attack was only a feint, forcing you to intercept a small strike force led by [[Ted]] sneaking into the Hospital. Happy to see you he claims to be here to save you.
