You successfully fight off the [[White Beast]] but before you can proceed the ground cracks and various monsters swarm out, destroying the whole Underground Sinner Experimentation Area. [[Subject R]] returns above ground and compliments your group for having survived the fight. [[Nightingale]] reasons that the real aim of her attack was destroying this area and everything else was just a diversion.
But Subject R denies the accusation, stating that she was dying to see you and wanted to give the Sinners freedom as well. But she is surprised [[Hella]] and [[Hecate]] stayed behind and accepted your [[Shackles]]. Asked why she didn't run Hecate just retorts that she doesn't need freedom. Which Subject R thinks isn't what a [[Sinner]] should be like. 

Nightingale orders her to stand down and accept the Shackles. But Subject R commands one of her creatures to capture you instead. Hecate tries to protect you but gets blocked by a swarm of monsters. When she comes close to taunt you, you try to shackle her.

>"So this is what it's like to be bound by the shackles... You've awakened an incredible power indeed."   

But she moves your hand away and the shackles shatter, having only removed her disguise. Looking at you with your real face she asks if you remember her. When you deny it she says:

>"Then remember it now. We'll see each other again when it's all over." 

When you ask her who she is gunfire from Nightingale interrupts the scene. She aims her gun at you and asks Subject R what she truly wants. Which causes her to release you. Safely in [[Nightmare|Nightmares]] embrace you watch as the White Beast recovers, driving everyone back with the wind from it's wings. Subject R mounts the beast while saying:

>"The secret will be revealed one day, but not now. Look at your cities. Look at what monsters human sin is breeding... This is the final revelry you will enjoy. Go witness the end of this revelry. Whatever happens, don't look away. If you can do it... I'll be waiting for you at the end with all the answers you have been looking for."   

Then the white beast takes flight carrying her away.

The scene cuts away to the [[FAC]] [[Adrian Sterling]] welcoming you as the new [[Chief]] of the [[MBCC]]. In the background a report about the incident is shown, which becomes standard at the end of a chapter.
>"Your response was impeccable, welcome back."  

\- FAC Commander in Chief

The reports notes that the main culprits fled to DisCity and are still at large, while loss assessment and repairs in the bureau are in progress.

A picture of Subject R is shown, naming her with the code name R for the first time, her whereabouts are unknown.  The date is noted as 12th of August in [[NF 112]]. The CiC notes that MBCC is a subordinate agency under the FAC.
It also states that over 200 severe [[Maniacs|manic patients]] were also kept at the MBCC, of whom roughly 2/3 escaped. The Restricted Zone 0 is beyond repair, with Hella and Hecate as the sole remaining Sinners.
> "I never expected to meet you again under these circumstances" 

\- FAC CiC

Chief is called SHP-13 (Shepard 13) for the first time in the report. Stating that their awakening was forced.
>"Forced disruption of conscious correction. Correction progress at 95.2%. Cannot continue. Cannot restart"

The black rings [[BR000]], [[BR001]], [[BR003]] showed signs of short term abnormal fluctuations.
No reports of Sinners entering Eastside but at least 6 fugitive Sinners entered the West District, which requires an urgent response.

After the report is a short conversation between Nightingale and the Commander in Chief. Nightingale states that conscious correction process can't continue, so they have no way to control the risks. Asking the CiC if he still wants to use SHP-13. But the CiC thinks they have no other choice.
