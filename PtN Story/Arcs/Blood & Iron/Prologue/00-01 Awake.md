In a dream [[Chief]] finds herself in a field of [[Crystal Flowers]], with one in her hands. Even though she doesn't remember anything, an unseen voice promises to be waiting for her.
Back in the waking world she is undergoing a personality repair program. Helplessly lying in the recovery pod she can watch a researcher being silenced by a female [[Subject R|intruder]]. But before the looming intruder can take you away [[Nightingale]] along with several armed guards storm in guns blazing. 

Her plan thwarted by their arrival she falls back to stealing Chief's appearance and bio signature before making her escape.
Pressed for time by the prison riot adjutant Nightingale can only dress her superior and explain that Chief is the warden of the [[MBCC]] prison. Therefore the primary target for the most dangerous inmates. She is their biggest obstacle to true freedom.

Their escape is stopped short in the central cell-block by a group of rioters. But the guards, led by the [[036|Guard Captain]] hold them off.

>Don't tell me that one behind is the new... Heh, look at her dumb face. I bet she' still just a loser.
