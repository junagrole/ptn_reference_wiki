[[Chief]] has a dream, standing in a field of [[Crystal Flowers]] while holding one. An unknown voice is asking them what they remember and telling Chief they will wait for them. 
Then Chief regains consciousness amid an intruder alert. They are lying in a recovery pod and a researcher warns them not to leave it before the personality repair program is finished. [[Subject R]] is leaning over them and silences the researcher. Before she can do anything else [[Nightingale]] along with several armed guards storms into the room and immediately opens fire on her. 
But Subject R recovers, summons several creatures to buy her time and gets close to Chief again. She collects a blood sample from Chief and assumes their appearance and bio signature, lamenting that this will have to do since she can't take you away now. Then she escapes.
Nightingale helps Chief up and explains the basic situation to the amnesiac Chief. They leave together with a group of guards.

They arrive at the central cell-block when an alarm wants that the prisoners have escaped. Nightingale explains that the [[MBCC]] is a prison for the most dangerous criminals, that are a threat to the world. And Chief, who is responsible for restraining them, will be their first target.
Rioters break through the security glass, happy to have found the new Chief.

>Rioter: "Don't tell me that one behind is the new... Heh, look at her dumb face. I bet she's still just a loser."

They try to kill Chief to earn their true freedom. But the [[036|Guard Captain]]  holds them off.
