Dreaming [[Chief]] finds herself in a field of [[Crystal Flowers]], holding one close. Even though she doesn't remember anything, an unseen voice promises to be waiting for her.
Though in the waking world she is safely confined in a recovery pod, undergoing a personality repair program. Until an [[Subject R|intruder]] takes out the attending researches and cracks open the pod. But before the beautiful [[Sinner]] can take Chief away adjutant [[Nightingale]] along with several guards storms in guns blazing. 

Her plan thwarted by their arrival the intruder falls back to stealing Chief's appearance and bio signature before making her escape.
Pressed for time by the prison riot adjutant Nightingale can only dress her superior and explain that Chief is the warden of the [[MBCC]] prison. Therefore the primary target for the most dangerous inmates. She is their biggest obstacle to true freedom.

Their escape is stopped short in the central cell-block by a group of rioters. But the guards, led by the [[036|Guard Captain]] hold them off.
