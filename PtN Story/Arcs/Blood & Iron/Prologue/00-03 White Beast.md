You finds yourself back in the flower field, whispering to someone:
>[!cite] Chief?
>"Come here, Hecate. This isn't over. We agreed..."

The person reaches out with a hand covered in black bandages while the blue field turns red. When you try to take the hand the dream fractures.

Meanwhile the battle is over and [[Hecate|S-019]] comes over to you, making you wonder if the dream was a lost memory. But S-019 denies having met you before. When you call her Hecate she says she doesn't need that name anymore, but is okay with it. The two Sinners and you meet up with [[Nightingale]], where [[Hella]] pretends to be well behaved. Though Nightingale is surprised that there were only two Sinners left and the others all escaped.

Noting that the riot is just a diversion the four of you chase after [[Subject R]]. Their pursuit is cut short by a creature created by your target. After a fight you arrive at the entrance to the Underground Sinner Experimentation Area. She taunts Nightingale that bullets are useless against her, which causes Nightingale to retort that her powers can't copy the [[Shackles]]. Subject R agrees that's a problem but she doesn't need it to enter this restricted area. She opens the sealed area with your stolen bio information and summons the [[White Beast]] to stall your progress. Nightingale warns you that it's a tough opponent before a fierce battle begins.
