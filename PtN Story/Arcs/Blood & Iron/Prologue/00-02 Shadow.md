After the rioters are dealt with [[Wendy]] appears screaming that she is on the way home and that Chief and the FAC are in her way again. She is joined by [[EMP]] who taunts and threatens the guard detail. Chiefs protective detail gets overwhelmed by the from multiple Sinners. [[036]] stays behind to hold the enemy off while [[Nightingale]] uses a force field to escape with Chief. 
The two flee via a secret passage until they reach an elevator leading to the hidden mezzanine (Intermediate floor). Nightingale is bleeding from a wound on her forehead. 
>"The bright red irritates your nerves and pokes at the unknown corners of your fractured memories."

Nightingale wants Chief to go down and hide until reinforcements arrive. But Chief doesn't really understands why so many people are risking their life to protect them and tells Nightingale that they want to help instead.
Remembering the encounter with the Rioters she realises that the reason they want to kill her is because she has the power to supress them. 
Over the objections of Nightingale that they just woke up from the disrupted repair program and are still weak and without memories, Chief insists and overrules her. Nightingale relents and changes the lifts destination to a special detention area instead. To recover their special power. (The [[Shackles]], even if they are not named yet)
>"Chief, a forbidden power lies dormant in the depth of this jail. It's more dangerous and powerful than our enemies."

Nightingale stays behind and gets ready to face the rioters while Chief takes the Elevator down. It takes Chief to the Restricted Area where they are to locate the only prisoner that stayed voluntarily in their cell. In the middle section of Area B-3 with number [[Hecate|S-019]] .
A girl in a cell introduces herself as [[Hella]], believing Chief to be a new guard. She claims to be harmless and asks Chief to let her out. But Chief notices that the cell door has been damaged and bend steel pipe at the girls feet. Unable to keep up the pretence Hella screams at them and smashes the glass before dragging Chief by the collar, trapping them against her cell. She threatens Chief to open or the door or she will kill them.
A shadow forces her back and we see a girl cowering in another cell. The shadow clearly being hers. Chiefs asks if they are S-019, which the girl affirms. Emotionless she asks if [[Nightingale]] send them down and if she has new orders. She recognises them as the new Chief which prompts an outburst from Hella swearing she'll kill Chief. But the shadow attacks Hella instead and S-019 threatens to kill her instead.
She walks towards you and her shadow wraps around you, instructing you to stay still. 
>"Don't move... It hates when prey struggles."

She clarifies that she is an A rank [[Sinner]] with the ability "curse of nightmare", telling Chief that down her are the real criminals and that Chief uses the Shackles to bind them. She asks them if they found their Shackles.
>"In the darkness, all you can see is this young girl in front of you. Under her icy gaze, a series of obscure words crawls into your body, crashing your head, screaming to tear your soul apart. S-019: Stop it, or get killed"

Encouraged by the young Sinner Chief manages to activate the shackles, which creates a reaction in her left eye. A bright white-blue spark. The shackles first bind S-019 and then the screaming Hella. Chief describes the feeling of using the Shackles like getting a glimpse of some insane madness. 
Hella swears to kill you, but S-019 coldly states she can't. Having awakened their dormant power Chief clearly sees her nightmare now. Rioters storm in and S-019 asks for orders.
>"You are now an actual Chief. Please give me orders. From now on, I only follow your orders."

The two Sinners clear out the Rioters.
