In N.F. 84.12.22 an explosion occurred in the [[DisSea]] region. Spreading [[Mania]] across the city. The initial explosion resulted in at least 97,231 [[Maniacs]].

The incident was the first public Mania crisis, which led to the formation of the [[FAC]]. But there are only very limited information available about it.
