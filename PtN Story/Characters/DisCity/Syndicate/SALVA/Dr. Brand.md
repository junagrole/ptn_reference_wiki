A doctor at [[SALVA Hospital]]. In [[NF 112]] he led an ambulance into [[Syndicate]] to treat [[Maniacs]] among the gang members. Unfortunately they got into conflict with [[Ted]] and the [[MBCC]] squad searching for [[Subject R]]. 

He was interrogated by Ted who threatened his wounded colleague, [[Laura]]. Distraught by her pain and desperately wanting to save her he shared the little he knew about a Sinner being brought in by [[Anne]] and the absence of [[Dr. Iron]].

When the party left he was seen desperately treating Laura, while crying over her dying body.

Stricken with grief and anger he succumbed to [[Mania]] and when he made it back to the Hospital he finally transformed into a [[Corruptors|Corruptor]] and attacked the ones who had hurt his friends. He died in battle with [[Chief]], [[Hella]] and [[Hecate]].
