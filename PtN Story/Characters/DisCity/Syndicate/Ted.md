## Background
Leader of a small gang in [[Syndicate]]. Is quite well recognised by other gangs, but not respected. 

He lost his eye and got infected by Mania in a gang fight, but was treated by [[Dr. Iron]]. Along with the artificial eye came the inability to use a [[Mania Crystal]]. Denied the power of Mania he developed a burning hatred for Sinners. Fearing their powers but also desiring it.

## Descent into Darkness
When he bought a [[Gray-haired Girl|young Sinner]] he and his gang abused and tortured her. Trying to break her into total obedience. 

To take revenge on Iron he made a deal with an unnamed group for Mania Crystals and [[Underground]] mania technology. In return he would track down the [[Inheritance]] and a fugitive Sinner for them. Since the group also hates the [[Organisations/Security Forces/MBCC|MBCC]] it's very likely that he made contact with an actual underground agent or a direct proxy.

## Attack on Salva
By becoming an informant for the [[Public Security Bureau]] Ted learned about [[Chief]] tracking down a fugitive Sinner in Syndicate. Staging a foiled assassination attempt, by the young Sinner he brutalised, he inserted himself into the manhunt. Shooting his own Sinner had the dual purpose of baiting the SALVA doctors to bring her into the heavily fortified [[SALVA Hospital]].

Ted soon showed his psychopathic side by torturing [[Laura]], [[Anne]] and [[Dr. Brand]] and turning his own gang members into [[Maniacs]]. His assault on SALVA proved fruitless when neither the inheritance nor the Sinner were in the hospital. When the young Sinner went manic he fled from the scene, planning to launch a second assault to destroy SALVA and kill Chief.

## Demise
But both his flight and plans where cut short when he run into Dr. Iron. Last time he was seen he was mindlessly smiling at Irons feet after being lobotomised by her.
