## Phase 1
Required evidence: 
- Public Security Bureau Record
- Parma Report II
- S-098 Arrest Report
As with most interrogations, we start with Hella in said interrogation room, on the chair. She is startled by the bright lights that turn on when the interrogation starts, and Chief immediately offers to turn them down. Hella refuses, stating their purpose to be intimidation, then challenges chief's experience. Chief can either be sympathetic or cold, but Hella will interpret is as part of the "good cop-bad cop" routine. it's now evident that she is not in a good mood. She brings up her file in the Public Security Bureau, which prompts the use of the first evidence.

Public Security Bureau Record
	From N.F.100 to N.F.109 Hella is has in her criminal record 26 thefts, 25 scams, 5 kidnappings and 15 prison breaks. The notes of two PSB officers are also present, badmouthing her and noting her panache for using sympathy towards her as a weapon. Chief is not fond of the file. She notes that nowhere in said file are Hella's powers explained, being captured and injured making her come across as weak girl instead.

Asking about the inconsistency, Hella explains that she wasn't born a Sinner. She mocks the predictable following questions, noting they've been asked before. Weather Chief choses to ask anyways in a gentle or harsh tone, Hella instead goads them into presenting the second piece of evidence.

S-098 Arrest Report
	This file documents Hella's arrest in N.F.112. Medical examination reveals signs of experiments for more then three years, which matches with Hella's absent criminal record from N.F.109 to N.F.111. As such, the FAC suspects Hella to be an artificially created Sinner. To that, Hella feigns ignorance, bringing up her lack of education as an excuse. This prompts the use of the last piece of evidence.

Parma Report II
	Chief mentions that the following data is recovered from a Mania Weapon
