An inland sea formed in the impact crater of the [[Perishing Star]]. DisCity was established at it's shore to mine [[Hypercube|Hypercubes]]. After the [[DisSea explosion]] revealing [[BR000]] mining operations were severely compromised. 

To contain the contamination the [[Broken Frontline]] was established.
